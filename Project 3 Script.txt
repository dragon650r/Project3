Good evening, everyone! My name is Jose, and I’m here with my team members Hunter and Aidan. Today, we’re presenting our project on analyzing Netflix’s movies and TV shows dataset. Our goal was to find the most prolific directors and actors in the Netflix library, based on data from Kaggle.

Our main objective was to identify trends in Netflix’s content library by focusing on the careers of top actors and directors. To do this, we’ve created several visualizations: a bar chart showing the most common actors and directors, a network graph illustrating collaborations between actors and directors, and a timeline chart depicting the career trajectories of actors over time.

We used a dataset from Kaggle containing Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows. We stored the data in a PostgreSQL database to enable easy querying and manipulation. For the visualizations, we used Python libraries: Plotly Express for interactive graphs, Bokeh for network visualizations, and Matplotlib for static charts. We also built a Flask app to allow user interaction with the graphs, filtering by year or genre to explore the data more dynamically.

Our first visualization is a bar chart that displays the most common directors and actors in the Netflix library. As you can see, certain directors have worked on multiple projects, contributing significantly to the catalog. Next, we have a network graph showing the collaboration between actors and directors. This allows us to visualize patterns of teamwork across various movies and shows. Finally, the timeline chart tracks the career trajectories of actors over the years. It shows how long their careers have spanned and how many projects they’ve been involved in.Our first visualization is a bar chart that displays the most common directors and actors in the Netflix library.

From our analysis, we found some interesting trends, such as certain directors consistently working on Netflix projects across many years. Also, some actors have had long careers on the platform, appearing in multiple projects spanning years. These findings highlight the deep collaboration between directors and actors and the evolving nature of Netflix’s content.

Overall, this project gave us a better understanding of how Netflix has built its content library through long-term collaborations between directors and actors. We hope these visualizations provide insight into the patterns that have shaped the platform’s offerings. Thank you for your attention, and we’re happy to take any questions.
